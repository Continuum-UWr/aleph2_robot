namespace kaco {

	/// This class represents a CanOpen slave device in the network.
	///
	/// It provides easy access to it's object dictionary entries via
	/// addesses or names. There is a locally cached version of the
	/// device's object dictionary. This allows for dynamically mapping
	/// entries to transmit and receive PDOs. This abstracts away the
	/// underlaying communication method when manipulating the dictionary.
	/// The device object must know the structure of the slave's dictionary
	/// for these features, however, it can be fetched automatically from
	/// an EDS file or from KaCanOpen's EDS library.
	///
	/// Call print_dictionary() if you want to know which entries are
	/// accessible by name.
	///
	/// ### Remarks on thread-safety:
	///
	///   There are three classes of methods:
	///
	///     (1) Methods which manipulate the dictionary structure
	///
	///     (2) Methods which access dictionary entries
	///
	///     (3) Methods which only access Core (private)
	///
	///    Methods in (3) as well as get_node_id() are always thread-safe.
	///
	///    Methods in (2) are thread-safe if they are not intermixed with
	///    methods in (1).
	///
	///    Methods in (1) should be run in sequence before accessing
	///    dictionary entries (group 2).
