# CanFestival drivers

The drivers in this directory are taken from the
[CanFestival project](http://www.canfestival.org/).
We have replaced the makefiles by more modern
CMake files. There have only been small changes
to the original source code. If a file is changed,
there exists a corresponding difference file
comparing to the _CanFestival-3_ version from
<http://dev.automforge.net/> on 03 August 2015.

The drivers are binary compatible. However, we
distribute them here in order to simplify the
build process. Not all original drivers are
ported yet, because many of them cannot be tested
by us. If you have made currently unsupported
hardware working, we are happy if you contribute
your work to the project.

Some drivers have external dependencies. They are
listed here:
